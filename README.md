The car advertisement dataset
[Link to running app](https://software-development-tools-project-1.onrender.com)

This project aims to provide you with additional practice on common software engineering tasks. These tasks will augment and complement your data skills, and make you a more attractive job candidate to potential employers. 

You will be asked to develop and deploy a web application to a cloud service so that it is accessible to the public.

In this project, we will provide you with the dataset on car sales advertisements, which youâ€™ve already worked with in the past.

The project is split into several steps that replicate the process described in our blog post here, but we will be using the Render platform instead of Heroku.
